# Simpl Assignment

A brief description of the thought process while desinging and the assumptions that were made.
#Structure

- Components folder contains different section of the UI components.
- Assests folder contain logos and icons.
- App.js is where all components resides.
- Style.css contains all the css for the app.

# Thought process

- Since there is no clear understanding of what data is dynamaic and how much more of data that can come in particular component UI. I have created Ui with skeleton approach where dynamic data can come.
- I haven't made UI responsive below 300px width considering no smartphone will have that small UI. ALthough we could easily do that by changing things in mock-up like removing big Icon/Logos and making them small in front of title.
- In Account component, I have heavily used svg as i could easily copy it from figma. I didn't realize we can export those as png file which i have done for rest of the component.
- Scope of this project cosidered as defined in Figma app. Considering that I have kept all css in one file. Although it would make sense to have each component having their own CSS file for large project.
